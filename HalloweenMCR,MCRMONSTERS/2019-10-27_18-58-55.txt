#enjoytheordinaryinoctober These two have taught me so much about enjoying the ordinary ðŸ’œ

Today we had a fun packed day in Manchester doing the free Halloween activities #mcrmonsters #halloweenmcr and I took lots of brilliant photos and there were so many magical moments (see my stories for highlights) BUT it was watching them on the tram that was favourite moment.

A simple ride on public transport was part of the adventure for them. They excitedly viewed the journey with wondrous eyes. How often do we enjoy a journey? We need to stop focusing on the destination and enjoy the ride, don't we?
